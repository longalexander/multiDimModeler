**WORK IN PROGRESS**. 

**WHAT**: Prototype of a multidimensional spreadsheet application based on existing software like Quantrix Qloud.

**WHEN**: Work Started on Mon Feb 10 2020. I first encountered multidimensional spreadsheet applications a couple of days before starting to build.

**WHY**: If you look at the public domain, there's a lot of conceptual material on how to build an OLAP tool like this. But there doesn't seem to be anything fine grained like a youtube tutorial etc. therefore interesting to work on. I've mostly worked with frontend so far and a little bit of backend. This seemed like a fun project to develop my backend skills. (This will be React + AWS).
