WORK IN PROGRESS

This project is a prototype of a multidimensional spreadsheet application based on existing software like Quantrix Qloud.

I first encountered multidimensional spreadsheet applications a couple of days before starting to build.

If you look at the public domain, there's a lot of conceptual material on how to build an OLAP tool like this. But there doesn't seem to be anything fine grained like a youtube tutorial etc.

I've mostly worked with React/frontend so far. This seemed like a fun project to develop my backend skill.
